# Landing page for app Foodquest
Foodquest is an app for gastronomic travel in a game format. This is my learning project for a landing page, which I completed during my design course. I developed the concept and created its visualization. You can view the design project on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/198541793/Foodquest-app-Brand-Identity-UXUI-Landing-page).

My goal was to demonstrate how I envision my website in the web space and how it adapts to different screen resolutions.
